# Atlas configuration (`config.toml`)

Reference for Atlas's user-facing preferences file. Written for both humans
hand-editing the file and agents using the `atlas-self-configure` skill
(`src-tauri/resources/skills/atlas-self-configure/SKILL.md`) — the skill's
key table is a copy of the one below, and both are compiled into the test
binary via `include_str!` so a Rust test (`every_known_setting_key_is_*` in
`state/atlas_config.rs`) fails the build the moment either one drops a key;
see [Testing](#testing).

- **Source of truth (Rust):** `src-tauri/src/state/atlas_config.rs`
  (schema, defaults, validation, migration) and
  `src-tauri/src/commands/atlas_config.rs` (Tauri commands + file watcher).
- **Frontend wrapper:** `src/features/settings/lib/atlas-config-api.ts`.
- **Design context:** GitHub issue #64.

## Location

```
~/.config/atlas/config.toml
```

The same path on every platform, and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/atlas/config.toml`
when that variable is set to an absolute path. A relative value is ignored
rather than resolved against the cwd — a GUI app launched from Finder has an
arbitrary one.

Deliberately **not** Tauri's `app_config_dir()`, which on macOS is
`~/Library/Application Support/dev.atlas.ide/`. This file exists to be opened
and hand-edited, by a person or an agent, and a path they can type is part of
that; a bundle id buried under `Application Support` is not. Zed makes the same
call for the same reason (`~/.config/zed/settings.json` on macOS), and it puts
Atlas's config beside every other tool a developer already keeps in
`~/.config`.

This is a split, not a move. Everything else Atlas persists stays in the
platform data directory, because none of it is a document anyone should be
editing:

| Stays in `app_config_dir()` | Why |
|---|---|
| `state.json` | Workspaces, recents, orgs — machine-managed. |
| `device.json` | Telemetry identity; see the exclusions below. |
| `telemetry.json` | Self-hosted PostHog override. |
| `models-pricing.json`, `byok-usage.jsonl` | Caches. |
| `session-chat/`, comms state | Session data. |

In application code, call `ConfigManager::config_path()` (Rust) or the
`get_atlas_config_info` command (frontend) rather than rebuilding the path.

## Format

TOML, edited through `toml_edit` rather than reserialized wholesale, so a
patch from the Settings UI or an agent preserves comments, key order, and any
key Atlas doesn't recognize. Chosen over JSON (no comments) and YAML
(ambiguous scalar parsing for a file humans and agents both hand-edit).

Atlas writes the file **self-documenting**: a header, then a comment above
every key giving what it does, its default, and any constraint on its value.
Those comments come from `SETTINGS_DOCS` in `state/atlas_config.rs` — the same
table `unknown_keys_in` uses to decide what Atlas recognizes — so they can't
drift from what validation accepts.

That is deliberate, and it's why the bundled `atlas-self-configure` skill
carries no key table of its own: an agent reads the real file and gets a
schema that matches the build in front of it, instead of a copy in a skill
that was projected into `~/.agents/skills` at some earlier version. The
`settings_docs_cover_every_setting` and
`the_self_configure_skill_defers_to_the_files_own_comments` tests hold both
halves of that in place.

A generated file looks like this (abridged — every key gets the same
treatment):

```toml
# Atlas configuration.
#
# Every user-facing Atlas preference lives here. Edit this file by hand or use
# Settings — both write to it, and Atlas picks up external edits live, with no
# restart needed for any key below.
#
# Your comments, formatting, and any keys Atlas doesn't recognize survive its
# own writes. An invalid value is rejected whole: Atlas keeps running on the
# last settings that loaded cleanly, shows the error in Settings, and leaves
# this file exactly as you wrote it.

# Format version of this file. Atlas manages it; leave it alone.
schemaVersion = 1

[settings]

terminalLineHeight = 1.4

# (default: "normal")
terminalFontWeight = "normal"
```

Note `updaterIgnoredVersion`: a key that serializes to nothing still gets its
comment, carried down onto the next key that is present. Otherwise the one key
whose *absence* carries meaning would be the one key nothing explains.

Comments are only ever written into a file Atlas generates — first migration,
or "Recreate defaults". Atlas never injects them into a file a user or agent
wrote; `toml_edit` just preserves whatever comments are already there.

Any other key under `[settings]` is left on disk untouched and reported as an
`unknownKeys` entry in `get_atlas_config_info` — never treated as an error,
never deleted.

### Non-goals for validation

`codeEditorTheme`/`atlasTheme` are checked for non-emptiness, not membership
in the frontend's theme catalogs (`src/features/theme/themes.ts`,
`src/features/editor/themes/themes.ts`). Duplicating that catalog into Rust
would create a second list that has to stay in sync with the frontend one —
trading one drift bug for another. An unrecognized-but-well-formed theme id
is accepted here and handled the same way the frontend already handles one
from a newer Atlas version.

## Schema versioning

`config.toml`'s `schemaVersion` is independent of `state.json`'s
`AppState::SCHEMA_VERSION` — the two files describe different domains and
evolve on separate timelines. Current: `CONFIG_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`
(`state/atlas_config.rs`).

- A file with a *lower* version is meant to run through sequential, idempotent
  migrations, the same pattern `AppState::migrate()` already uses for
  `state.json`. **Not yet implemented as code** — `CONFIG_SCHEMA_VERSION` is
  still `1`, so there is nothing to migrate from today; a real v1→v2 bump is
  what will exercise this path for the first time. Field-level
  `#[serde(default = ...)]` already covers the common case (a new key added
  within v1) without needing a version bump at all.
- A file with a *higher* version than this Atlas build supports is rejected
  outright — last-known-good settings stay active, the file is left alone.
  (This is what happens when a newer Atlas version's config is opened by an
  older build.)

## Precedence and scope

```
compiled defaults  <  validated config.toml
```

Global only. There is no project-level override and no durable UI/session
layer — a Settings UI change **is** a `config.toml` write, immediately.
"Project scope" is explicitly out of scope for this design; a future project-
level preference would need its own design (ownership, eligible keys,
location, precedence), not silent inheritance of this mechanism.

## Loading, validation, and failure behavior

Every read — cold start, a UI patch, an external edit picked up by the
watcher — validates the **complete candidate** before it replaces anything.
A malformed or invalid file never partially applies and never gets
auto-repaired, renamed, or overwritten by Atlas on its own:

- **Cold start, file missing:** normal (pre-migration, or the user deleted
  it on purpose) — served compiled defaults, `status: "ok"`.
- **Cold start, file malformed:** served compiled defaults in memory,
  `status: "usingDefaults"` with the parse/validation error. The file itself
  is never touched.
- **Hot reload (external edit) is malformed:** the previous, already-
  validated settings stay effective, `status: "usingLastKnownGood"` with the
  error. The malformed file is left exactly as written.
- **A UI/agent patch would produce an invalid candidate:** rejected outright
  (`update_atlas_settings` returns an error); nothing is written.
- **A UI/agent patch arrives while the on-disk file is currently
  malformed:** also rejected — a patch is never allowed to paper over a
  file it didn't validate first.

Any status other than `"ok"` reaches the user as a banner at the top of
Settings → General, with "Open config" and "Recreate defaults" beside it.
Both the boot-time status (carried on `bootstrap_app_state`'s
`configStatus`) and later hot-reload failures (`atlas:config-error`) land
there, so a config that failed to load at startup can't quietly serve
defaults — including flipping `shareTelemetry` back on — without saying so.

A file that exists but cannot be *read* at all (permissions, a transient I/O
fault) is treated as `"usingDefaults"`, not as an absent file — as is a
config directory that can't be resolved, and a migration write that fails.
The distinction matters for migration: see below.

"Defaults" there means *compiled* defaults only once migration has been
recorded. Before that, a broken or unwritable `config.toml` falls back to the
legacy `state.json` settings instead, so the user keeps their real
preferences (their telemetry opt-out included) for the session rather than
silently reverting while those preferences sit unused on disk.

The only path allowed to overwrite a malformed (or just unwanted) file is
"Recreate defaults" (`reset_atlas_config`), which backs the previous content
up to `config.toml.bak-<unix-seconds>` next to it before writing fresh
defaults.

## Live reload

Atlas watches `config.toml`'s parent directory (not the file itself — an
atomic save replaces the inode) and re-validates on any change. Every
setting in the schema is hot-reloadable; none requires a restart. A
successful reload emits `atlas:config-changed` with the new settings and a
`generation` counter; a rejected one emits `atlas:config-error` without
changing anything.

## Writing

The Settings UI and any agent both write through the same
read-modify-validate-atomic-write path:

1. Re-read the file from disk (closes the race with a concurrent external
   edit).
2. Merge only the changed key(s) into the parsed document via `toml_edit` —
   every other key, comment, and ordering is left untouched.
3. Validate the complete resulting candidate.
4. Re-check that the file still holds exactly the content step 1 read. If it
   moved, the merge base is stale: nothing is written and the whole sequence
   restarts on the fresh content (up to three times, then the write is
   refused with "config.toml is being written by something else"). This
   narrows — it cannot fully close, short of an advisory file lock — the
   window between the re-read and the swap, in which a concurrent external
   edit would otherwise be clobbered along with its comments.
5. Write to a uniquely-named temp file in the same directory, `fsync` it,
   then rename it over `config.toml` and `fsync` the directory. The sync
   before the rename is what makes the atomicity real: without it the rename
   can reach disk ahead of the bytes it points at, so power loss just after
   "Settings saved" could leave an empty or half-written file. Temp files are
   removed on every failure path rather than left beside the real config.

The Settings UI additionally passes an `expectedGeneration` — a stale value
(something else changed the file first) is reported back as a conflict. The
store adopts the fresh generation and retries the same patch, up to three
attempts in total, before surfacing an error; one retry wasn't enough to
survive a burst of rapid changes (dragging the zoom slider, say).

## Migration from `state.json`

Before issue #64, these settings lived in `state.json`'s `AppState.settings`
(schema v3 and earlier). On first launch after upgrading:

1. `state.json` is bumped to schema v4, which adds
   `settingsConfigMigrated: bool`.
2. If `config.toml` doesn't exist yet and the marker is `false`, the legacy
   `settings` object is extracted field-by-field (a value that doesn't parse
   is skipped, not fatal to the rest) and written as the new `config.toml`.
3. The marker is then set `true` — this is what stops Atlas from
   resurrecting stale `state.json` settings if the user later deletes
   `config.toml` on purpose.

The marker is set **only** once `config.toml` demonstrably holds the
settings: it either loaded cleanly or was just created. If the file exists
but is malformed or unreadable, migration is deliberately left unrecorded,
because `state.json`'s `settings` object is still the only surviving copy of
the user's preferences at that point.

That copy is protected from the other end too. The typed `AppState` has no
`settings` field any more, so serializing it over `state.json` wholesale
would delete the legacy object — and `state.json` gets saved for reasons
that have nothing to do with settings (a rotated telemetry id, a workspace
change). `AppState::save` therefore merges over whatever the file already
holds rather than replacing it, and drops the legacy `settings` key only
once `settingsConfigMigrated` is `true`. It writes through a uniquely-named
temp file, `fsync`ed before the rename, for the same reasons `config.toml`
does.

And the preserved copy is actually used: while the marker is `false` and
`config.toml` is unreadable, unparseable, or couldn't be written, those
legacy settings become the effective ones. "Recreate defaults" still writes
compiled defaults — that is what the button says — so it discards them; the
banner offers "Open config" first for exactly that reason.

One extra field, `adaptiveSuggestions`, existed on the frontend but had no
Rust-side counterpart before this migration; it's now part of the schema
above, closing that drift. Legacy values `"parse"`/`"llm"` (from before it
was a closed enum) normalize to `"agent"` during migration only — the live
schema accepts only `"agent"` or `"off"`.

## What's explicitly NOT in this file

- **API keys / credentials.** Atlas doesn't store these itself at all — see
  `src-tauri/src/commands/byok.rs`; they live in the user's shell profile.
- **Telemetry identity** (`device.json`) and the **self-hosted PostHog
  override** (`telemetry.json`) — deliberately separate files. Their split
  from coarse settings writes fixed a real bug (a settings save used to wipe
  the telemetry anonymous id); folding them back in would reverse that fix.
  `shareTelemetry`/`linkTelemetryToAccount` (the on/off preferences) stay in
  `config.toml` — only the identity/override files are excluded.
- **Session history, transcripts, per-project `.atlas/` state.** File-backed,
  but not a "setting," and out of scope until an explicit ownership design
  says otherwise.
- **Any "is a credential configured" presence flag.** Even a boolean is
  security-sensitive derived state; the BYOK UI computes availability at
  runtime from the environment instead of persisting it here.

## Testing

- Rust: `src-tauri/src/state/atlas_config.rs` (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`) —
  defaults, missing-key fallback, comment/unknown-key preservation across a
  patch, invalid values, unsupported future schema, malformed cold-start and
  hot-reload behavior, generation conflicts, reset/backup, and the legacy
  migration extraction (including the `adaptiveSuggestions` normalization).
  Also: the compare-and-swap that refuses a write on a stale base, temp-file
  cleanup, external-edit adoption (generation bump + dedup on re-read),
  `ConfigStatus`'s wire shape, and that a malformed or unreadable
  `config.toml` never reports migration as done.
- Rust: `src-tauri/src/state/app_state.rs` — a legacy `settings` key in
  `state.json` doesn't break parsing of the rest of the file, survives a save
  made before migration is recorded, and is dropped once it is.
