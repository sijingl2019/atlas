/**
 * Apache-2.0 obligations for the vendored engine (issue #44, spec D11 / Phase 1).
 *
 * Atlas's own code is **MIT** (`LICENSE`, "Copyright (c) 2026 Adib Mohsin");
 * the vendored engine is **Apache-2.0**. The second cannot be absorbed into the
 * first — Apache-2.0 code stays Apache-2.0 however it is bundled — so the
 * obligations travel with the distribution rather than being satisfied by
 * Atlas's own licence file.
 *
 * Three of §4's clauses land as testable facts, and each fails silently:
 *
 *   - **§4(a)/(d)** — the licence and the NOTICE must reach *recipients*. A
 *     file sitting in the repo does not; the shipped `.app` is what a user
 *     receives, and nothing in a normal build fails when a resource is missing
 *     from it.
 *   - **§4(b)** — every modified file must carry a prominent notice that it
 *     changed. The compiler has no opinion about a missing comment, and the
 *     set of modified files only grows.
 *   - **§4(c)** — attribution inside vendored sources is never stripped. The
 *     Phase 5 rename sweep is precisely the operation that would strip it, and
 *     that sweep has not run yet, so this test exists before its risk does.
 *
 * D11 gates all rename work on these being in place, which is why this lands
 * in Phase 1 rather than alongside the renames it protects.
