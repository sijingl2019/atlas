//! Handing the server to sessions.
//!
//! Every agent that can take the server is handed it on each session request
//! ([`MemorySessionOffers`]): an ACP session request carries the server in
//! `mcpServers` when the agent advertised `mcpCapabilities.http`; the native
//! agent gets it as a StreamableHttp entry in its thread's engine config. The
//! token is minted for the *request*, before a new session's id exists, and
//! bound to the id once the agent answers; an offer that never binds is
//! revoked. Each decision is logged, one line per session request.
