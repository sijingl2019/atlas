//! The live feed: a running conversation keeping its store row current.
//!
//! Ported from Zed's `ThreadMetadataStore::handle_conversation_event`
//! (`thread_metadata_store.rs:1265-1356`) and the subscription that drives it
//! (`:1188-1212`). Zed subscribes to every `ConversationView` it ever creates
//! and upserts on the events that could have changed what the sidebar shows.
//! Atlas has no views, so the host forwards its thread events here instead;
//! everything downstream of that is Zed's.
//!
//! The one piece that is Atlas's own is the thread-id resolution below, and it
//! exists because of a difference in when a session is created. Zed mints a
//! `ThreadId` up front and attaches a session later, so its drafts are
//! addressable and it keeps them. Atlas's chat panel opens an ACP session the
//! moment a tab mounts, so a draft here already *has* a session — one that is
//! thrown away and re-created on reload, which is exactly why its id must not
//! be persisted (`:1286-1290`), and therefore why a draft row is unreachable
//! the moment its process forgets it. Atlas consequently deletes a draft rather
//! than keeping it: see [`ThreadRecorder::forget`]. CONTEXT.md records the
//! divergence under *Draft*.
