//! The session-delta wire types — FROZEN (`docs/agents/delta-wire-contract.md`).
//!
//! These shapes are what `CaptureMiddleware`, the analytics/transcript/memory
//! middleware and the whole chat UI pattern-match on. They may not drift during
//! the ACP port; if a stack cannot produce one verbatim, the port stops and
//! every consumer is updated in the same change (research §D12-1).
//!
//! They live in their own crate for one reason: **both ACP stacks have to
//! produce them.** The old stack is on `agent-client-protocol` 1.3, the ported
//! one on 2.0, and the two can never share a Cargo graph — the protocol crate
//! pins its schema crate exactly (`=1.4.0` / `=1.5.0`). A wire type defined in
//! either stack is therefore unreachable from the other. Defined here, it is
//! one type for both, so `CaptureMiddleware` keeps matching on the same enum no
//! matter which stack produced the event.
//!
//! These shapes are the FROZEN wire contract (`docs/agents/delta-wire-contract.md`
//! and `src/types/agents.ts`). The old `atlas-agents` crate re-exported them;
//! it is gone, and `atlas-agent-delta` is where they are projected now.
