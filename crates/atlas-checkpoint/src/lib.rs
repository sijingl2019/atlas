//! Atlas's record of what its agents did, and which commits it produced.
//!
//! # The problem
//!
//! Agent Sessions are ephemeral. They live in the sidebar until they scroll
//! away, and the reasoning behind a change is gone the moment the conversation
//! ends — so six weeks later nobody can answer "why was it written this way",
//! including the person who wrote it. In an Organisation it is worse: two
//! developers working the same repository cannot see what the other's agent did,
//! and every Session starts from zero.
//!
//! # The shape
//!
//! A Session is one agent conversation. Its Messages are the only place the
//! transcript lives. A **Checkpoint** is the slice of one Session whose work
//! landed in one git commit — identified by the `(Session, commit)` pair, and
//! carrying no transcript of its own.
//!
//! Everything is written to `.atlas/sessions.db`, a SQLite database in the
//! Workspace's already-gitignored state directory, with bodies over 64 KB
//! spilled to content-addressed files beside it. The tables mirror the eventual
//! server shape so syncing is a copy rather than a translation, and the outbox
//! is a `sync_state` column on each row rather than a separate queue — which is
//! what makes Local mode the same code path with draining switched off, instead
//! of a second thing to keep correct.
//!
//! # Three properties worth stating outright
//!
//! **Redaction runs before persistence.** Not before upload. An agent that reads
//! a `.env` puts its contents verbatim into the transcript, so the guarantee has
//! to hold at the point of writing or it does not hold at all. See
//! [`capture`] — it is the only module that may write agent content, and it
//! fails closed if scrubbing does not complete.
//!
//! **Nothing here touches the network.** Capture never waits on a connection, so
//! offline is the ordinary case rather than a degraded one, and a Workspace can
//! stay Local forever with the full timeline available.
//!
//! **Commits are observed, not intercepted.** No git hooks: they mutate the
//! user's repository, have to chain whatever else is installed, and — decisively
//! — cannot see a commit made before they existed. Watching refs move can, which
//! is what lets a commit made from a terminal, from another editor, or while
//! Atlas was closed still find its Session.
//!
//! # Testing
//!
//! The crate is Tauri-free on purpose. Its tests drive the public API against a
//! real temporary directory, a real SQLite database and a real git repository —
//! no mock traits, no assertions on internal call ordering. What is asserted is
//! what ends up in the store.
