//! MCP servers the host hands a native session, as engine configuration.
//!
//! ACP agents receive MCP servers on the session request; the engine reads
//! them from its configuration (`mcp_servers.<name>`). A thread's
//! `thread/start` and `thread/resume` carry per-thread config overrides in the
//! same dotted spelling as the connection's own, so each thread gets its own
//! entry — and with it its own bearer token, which a connection-wide override
//! could not carry.
//!
//! Only HTTP servers are projected: the engine speaks StreamableHttp natively,
//! and the host offers nothing else today. The memory tool server is the host's
//! own, so its tools run without an approval prompt — the same standing the
//! dynamic `search_memory` tool it replaced had — and they are kept out of the
//! **deferred** surface, which puts them in the model's initial tool list
//! instead of behind a tool search.
//!
//! That second one is the whole of the shared-memory read problem: deferred is
//! the engine's default for MCP tools on any model with a search tool, and a
//! model cannot call a handle it has to go looking for first. Whether it went
//! looking varied run to run, which is why memory was reliably written and
//! only sometimes read. Nothing about the protocol changes — memory is still
//! pulled by the agent, and nothing is added to the user's message (ADR-0010)
//! — only whether the handle is visible.
//!
//! Both of those standings are the host's to grant, and both ride on the
//! sentence above: everything projected here is a server Atlas itself offers.
//! A user-configured HTTP server would inherit them, so that assumption is
//! load-bearing rather than incidental.
