//! The ported Codex engine, behind the seam.
//!
//! This module used to be gated on the `ported-engine` feature — the
//! development-time switch of spec Phase 2, kept while the Cersei path was
//! still shipping. The cutover happened: #54 deleted the feature and the
//! Cersei path with it, so the engine is unconditional now and there is no
//! kill switch here. (The feature's deletion also caused the #54 auth outage
//! — four `#[cfg(feature = "ported-engine")]` blocks compiled to nothing —
//! which is why `unexpected_cfgs` is a workspace deny, #60.)
//!
//! The surface is ADR-0004's: the engine is driven **in-process at the
//! app-server layer**, through `codex-app-server-client`, and `src-tauri` sees
//! only the `AgentServer` / `AgentConnection` traits it already speaks.
//!
//! Layout mirrors the Cersei-path seam next door, so the two are readable
//! side by side:
//!
//! - [`auth`] — the D10 token provider (`ExternalAuth` over an Atlas access JWT)
//! - [`catalog_cache`] — the gateway's model catalogue, fetched and cached
//!   (ADR-0007); [`catalog`] projects one of its rows into the engine's record,
//!   because the gateway's own `/models` is shape-incompatible with the
//!   engine's fetch
//! - [`config`] — engine config assembly, which the spec puts *here* rather than
//!   in `src-tauri`: the seam is the only place that knows both Atlas's settings
//!   and the engine's shape
