//! Assembling the engine's configuration.
//!
//! The spec puts this **in the seam**, not in `src-tauri` and not in the
//! engine: the seam is the only place that knows both Atlas's settings and the
//! engine's shape, and keeping it here is what lets `src-tauri` go on calling
//! nothing but the `AgentConnection` trait.
//!
//! Config reaches the engine two ways, and the split is not arbitrary:
//!
//! - **`ConfigOverrides`** for the things that have no config-file spelling.
//!   `codex_self_exe` is the load-bearing one — the engine's own docs say it
//!   "cannot be set in the config file: it must be set in code via
//!   `ConfigOverrides`". Sandbox and approval defaults ride along here too.
//! - **TOML overrides** for everything that *is* a config key: the provider
//!   definition and the analytics switch. Going through the documented key path
//!   means the engine's own `validate_model_providers` runs over what we built,
//!   so a malformed provider fails at config load with the engine's error rather
//!   than at the first request with ours.
