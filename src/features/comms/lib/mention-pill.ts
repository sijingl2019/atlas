// One definition of a mention pill, for the two places that draw one.
//
// The rendered message draws it in React (`components/message-body-impl`); the
// composer draws it as a CodeMirror widget, which is plain DOM
// (`lib/cm-comms-mention`). They must be indistinguishable — the point of the
// composer chip is that what you are typing already looks like what you are
// about to send — so the classes and the avatar markup live here rather than
// being written out twice and drifting.
//
// Shape follows the house pill (the transcript's "Scroll to bottom" button):
// fully round, a hairline border, an elevated fill.
