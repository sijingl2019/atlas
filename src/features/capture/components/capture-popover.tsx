/**
 * Session capture setup and status, opened from the titlebar project pill.
 *
 * The load-bearing decision is that **Local is a real mode, not a waiting room
 * for Cloud**: one click, no account, no network, and it produces the complete
 * product. Cloud and Connect sit one level deeper as tabs, disabled with a
 * stated reason when unavailable — the requirement is obvious before the form
 * is filled in rather than after.
 *
 * Two flows end in a **disclosure step with real numbers** (Cloud create's
 * history import, and Local→Cloud promotion), because each is one of the only
 * bulk-disclosure moments in the feature. Both are steps *inside* the popover
 * rather than modal dialogs, and both invoke nothing until Confirm — closing
 * the popover mid-flow is a true cancel because there is nothing to undo.
 *
 * Ordering inside the Cloud confirm matters and is not obvious:
 * `capture_register_cloud` requires an existing binding, so Confirm runs
 * enable-Local → register → import-confirm. Running enable *before* the
 * disclosure would leave a bound Workspace behind a Cancel, which is exactly
 * what "Cancel = nothing happens" forbids.
 *
 * **Cloud follows the active Organisation, and only that one.** Capture is
 * per-project and a project belongs to the Organisation you are working in, so
 * offering a picker over every linked Organisation invites binding a repository
 * into a tenant you are not looking at — and the mistake is only visible later,
 * in a shared timeline. The Organisation row below is therefore a label, not a
 * choice.

/**
 * Cloud capture is switched off in the client.
 *
 * The ingest service (`ingest.tryatlas.cc`) currently answers **405 method not
 * allowed to every GET** — `GET /workspaces` and `GET /workspaces/slug-available`
 * are not deployed, only the POST routes are. So Connect could never list
 * anything ("Could not reach the server"), the Slug check could only ever say
 * "couldn't check", and Create-Cloud would bind a Workspace whose drain has
 * nowhere to read back from. None of that is a client fault and none of it is
 * fixable here.
 *
 * Local capture is unaffected — it never touches the network, which is the whole
 * point of it being a real mode rather than a waiting room.
 *
 * Flip this to `true` when the ingest service serves its read endpoints; nothing
 * else needs to change.
