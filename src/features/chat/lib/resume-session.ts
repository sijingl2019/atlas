 * Session resume, shared by every "open a past chat" path
 * (`session-sidebar.handleOpenAgent`, `openAgentSession`).
 *
 * **One paint, after the session is loaded** — Zed's model
 * (`conversation_view.rs:1149-1206`: the view is not built until `session/load`
 * resolves, and the thread accumulates replayed entries invisibly until then).
 *
 * This replaced a two-stage resume that painted the on-disk transcript first
 * and the authoritative snapshot second. The idea was that the disk content was
 * already there and the agent handshake was pure waiting — true, but the disk
 * transcript stores prose and images ONLY. It has no tool calls, no thinking,
 * no plan (`agent_transcript.rs` stores role/content/timestamp/model/attachments
 * and `transcript_to_messages` hard-codes `tool_calls: Vec::new()`). So the first
 * paint was *guaranteed* to be an incomplete render of the same conversation,
 * and the second paint — a whole-list replace that re-keyed every message —
 * remounted the transcript seconds later. That is exactly the "messages and
 * tool calls are missing and then suddenly they all load" the user reported;
 * it was the design working as written, not a race.
 *
 * A skeleton for the length of the agent handshake is the honest trade: nothing
 * is shown until what is shown is complete and correct.
 *
 * The disk transcript still has one job here — see `paintableMessages`.
