// Agent-advertised session config options (P2.2 of
// `plans/atlas-acp-parity-loop.md`).
//
// ACP lets an agent advertise arbitrary knobs — a thinking-level select, a
// "web search" boolean, whatever it wants — through `session/new`'s
// `configOptions` and keeps them current via `config_options_updated`. Atlas
// only ever read `category: "model"` out of that list (and normalised
// `"mode"`), so every other knob an agent offered was invisible and unsettable.
//
// This projects the raw JSON into something the composer can render. Kept pure
// and separate from the component so the filtering rules — which are the part
// with actual judgement in them — are testable without a DOM.

 *  This filter is load-bearing in both directions: whoever excludes a category

 *
 *  `model` now holds that bargain exactly — the filter and {@link modelSelectOf}
 *  test the same predicate, so an option is in the pill xor in the knobs.
 *  `mode` holds it one layer down: the mode pill is fed by ACP's `modes`
 *  state, and `session_modes_of` in `atlas-agent-servers` synthesises that
