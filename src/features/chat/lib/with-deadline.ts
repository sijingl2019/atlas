/**
 * A client-side deadline on an IPC hop that may never settle.
 *
 * The bind path (`agents_spawn`, `agents_new_session`) awaits Rust futures
 * that, before PR 2 of the stalled-start plan, had no timeout of their own: an
 * `npm install` against a black-hole registry, or a `session/new` into a
 * wedged app-server, simply never answered. An `await` with no deadline left
 * the panel's `pending` flag set for the life of the app, which silently
 * disabled every retry path (focus, sign-in, silent) — the "Starting Codex"
 * that never ends. This makes the hop REJECT instead, so the ordinary failure
 * path runs: the held message goes back to the queue chip, the status drops to
 * idle, the failure is logged and reported.
 *
 * Rejection only — the underlying promise is not cancelled (a JS promise
 * cannot be). Callers that need the backend to give up too kill the plugin.
