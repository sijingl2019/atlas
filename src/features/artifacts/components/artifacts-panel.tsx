 *   store answered and the Session does not exist. The first version collapsed
 *   the two and left a permanent spinner on any null result.
 * * **Everything resets on a Workspace switch** — open Session included. The
 *   old Session id means nothing in the new store.
 * * **Refresh is event-driven first** (`atlas:git-changed`, which the watcher
 *   emits on every repo move), with a 15 s poll as the fallback for capture
 *   writes that produce no git event — and the poll only runs while the tab is
